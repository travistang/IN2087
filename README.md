## How to set up the frontend + backend (on your machine)
- install `docker-compose`
- in the directory (where docker-compose.yml is), run `docker-compose up --build` (if that doesnt work, try with `sudo`)
- wait for docker to finish doing its stuffs (until you see something like `API is running in port 3000`
- try to type `localhost:1234` on your browser, then add `mongodb://mongo:27017/finda`, and press `connect`, then you should be able to see the internal structure of the Mongo.
- the frontend is running at `localhost:3001`
- the backend is running at `localhost:3000`
